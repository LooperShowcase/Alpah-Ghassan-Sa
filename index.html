    <h1>Tesla</h1>
    <h4>
      Tesla was incorporated in July 2003 by Martin Eberhard and Marc Tarpenning
      as Tesla Motors. The company's name is a tribute to inventor and
      electrical engineer Nikola Tesla. In February 2004, via a $6.5 million
      investment, Elon Musk became the largest shareholder of the company. He
      has served as CEO since 2008. According to Musk, the purpose of Tesla is
      to help expedite the move to sustainable transport and energy, obtained
      through electric vehicles and solar power. Tesla began production of its
      first car model, the Roadster sports car, in 2008. This was followed by
      the Model S sedan in 2012, the Model X SUV in 2015, the Model 3 sedan in
      2017, the Model Y crossover in 2020, and the Tesla Semi truck in 2022. The
      company plans to start production of the Cybertruck light-duty pickup
      truck in 2023.[8] The Model 3 is the all-time bestselling plug-in electric
      car worldwide, and in June 2021 became the first electric car to sell 1
      million units globally.[9] Tesla's 2022 full year deliveries were around
      1.31 million vehicles, a 40% increase over the previous year,[10][11] and
      cumulative sales totaled 3 million cars as of August 2022.[12] In October
      2021, Tesla's market capitalization reached $1 trillion, the sixth company
      to do so in U.S. history Tesla, Inc. (/ˈtɛslə/ TESS-lə or /ˈtɛzlə/
